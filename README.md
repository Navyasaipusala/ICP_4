**4. Briefly identify the difference between PCA and LDA**
Answer: When there are fewer samples in each class, PCA performs better. Less dimensionality can be achieved through class separability, since LDA works best on large datasets with several classes. Whereas LDA determines the directions of maximum class separability, PCA discovers the directions of largest variance regardless of class labels.
